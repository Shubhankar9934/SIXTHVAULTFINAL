# Email Delivery Issue Diagnosis & Solutions

## Problem Analysis

Based on the logs and code analysis, emails are being sent successfully (200 response) but not being received. Here are the identified issues:

### 1. **Frontend Email Route Issue**
- The frontend API route (`app/api/send-email/route.ts`) defaults to **simulation mode**
- It only uses the backend service when `useBackendService: true` is explicitly set
- Most email requests are being simulated, not actually sent

### 2. **Resend API Configuration**
- Resend API key is configured: `re_4nS8L25m_5Yuaq2ffwvDnmR8PqjAwzqxY`
- Email domain is set to: `sixth-vault.com`
- However, there might be domain verification issues

### 3. **Resend Testing Limitations**
- The backend service has logic to handle Resend's testing mode restrictions
- During testing, Resend only allows sending emails to verified email addresses
- Your email `shubhankarbittu9934@gmail.com` might not be verified in Resend

### 4. **Email Service Flow Issues**
- Frontend calls `/api/send-email` with `useBackendService: false` by default
- This causes emails to be simulated instead of actually sent
- The backend email service is never called for actual delivery

## Root Causes

1. **Default Simulation Mode**: Frontend defaults to simulation
2. **Resend Domain Verification**: Domain `sixth-vault.com` may not be verified
3. **Testing Mode Restrictions**: Resend limits testing to verified emails
4. **Missing Email Verification**: Recipient email not verified in Resend dashboard

## Solutions

### Immediate Fix (Development)
1. Force backend service usage in email calls
2. Add proper error handling and logging
3. Verify Resend domain configuration

### Long-term Fix (Production)
1. Verify domain in Resend dashboard
2. Add recipient email to verified list
3. Implement proper email delivery monitoring
4. Add fallback email providers

## Next Steps
1. Test current Resend configuration
2. Verify domain ownership
3. Add debugging for email delivery
4. Implement email delivery status tracking
