# Optional dependencies for enhanced multimodal capabilities
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_optional.txt

# Advanced PDF processing with image extraction
PyMuPDF>=1.23.0

# PowerPoint presentation processing
python-pptx>=0.6.21

# Advanced Word document processing
python-docx>=0.8.11

# OCR capabilities for image text extraction
pytesseract>=0.3.10
Pillow>=9.0.0

# Multimodal embeddings (image-text understanding)
# Using git+https for the latest CLIP version that works with modern PyTorch
git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git

# Alternative multimodal embeddings
open-clip-torch>=2.20.0

# Note: These dependencies are optional and the system will work without them
# Core functionality uses only the base requirements.txt dependencies
# Install only what you need based on your use cases:
#
# For basic enhanced extraction: PyMuPDF, python-pptx, python-docx
# For OCR capabilities: pytesseract, Pillow
# For multimodal embeddings: torch, clip-by-openai
# For better reranking: sentence-transformers (may already be installed)
